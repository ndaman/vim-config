CC2531 zigbee adapter arrived
broke at least one pin, need to solder some connections to program via arduino (already have programmer firmware on arduino)
Working to fix/replace radio on raspberry Pi
I think the spi bus is messing things up, need to reboot alarm panel (remove battery etc.) while Pi is running to fix alarm panel, then I'll check if nrf24 is still having issues
	SPI bus is not the problem :(, need to test a few more nrf24 chips
