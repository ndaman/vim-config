Khyati
	Current report is very lacking, needs to explain differences with Harjinder's results
	Her extrusion width makes no sense (less than nozzle diameter), very likely will need to repeat tests

Yacub
	Better than expected results
	Intralaminar specimens need some refinement

Nicolo
	Will probably follow Yacub's work and refine the intralaminar specimens

James
	Use diverging nozzle to compare with Yacub and Nicolo's work.
