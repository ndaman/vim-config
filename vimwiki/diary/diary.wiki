== TPC Welding Meeting ==
	I need to update documentation for Hemal by Monday
	I will take lead on Flux software evaluation
	
== Live lecture for Mechanics of Materials ==
	Need to upload

== Mechanics of Materials ==
 	Started recording lecture notes (finish Monday)
	Started writing new exam (finish and write rubric Tuesday)
	
== Damage Tolerance ==
	Posted homework solutions
	Need to record 2 lectures for next week
	
== Home ==
	soldered power connections on perfboard and logic converter
	need to solder connections to power transformer and buck converters then wire everything up
	
= 4/7/2020 =

== TPC Welding ==
	Requested Flux trial
	Richard handling documenation for Hemal
	
== Mechanics of Materials ==
	Updated lecture notes and numbers for consistency
	Finished with this week, ready for next week
	
== Damage Tolerance ==
	Updated lecture notes for consistency
	Finished recording lectures for this week
	Still need to upload lecture
	Need to grade homework and update next assignment
	
== Home ==
	Completely redid perfboard soldering (problems in previous and bad setup made it difficult to debug)
	New setup radio works, still need to test relay output and connect power
	Previous plan (convert 24 AC to 5V and 3.3V DC to power entire unit) did not have enough current, will use two power supplies now (one for AC and one for DC)
	Hope to finish tomorro
	
= 4/8/2020 =

== TPC Welding ==
	Got in touch with Flux people, need to set up a call for trial license
	
== Research ==
	Reviewed Khyati's report: it is not good, she reported a very small extrusion width, no discussion of difference with Harjinder's stiffness
	Jacob's report was surprisingly good, optimistic about future of fracture work, need to make sure James and Nico are able to follow in this progress trend
	
== Mechanics of Materials ==
	Ready to start recording next week's lecture
	
== Damage Tolerance ==
	Updated a few things in the lecture notes
	Need to upload pdf's through the end of Exam 2 material
	Need to write exam 2
	Started grading, need to finish
	
== Home ==
	Power input did not work, redid that portion of the circuit and it works great now
	Unfortunately, logic converter is not working, need to check wiring
	
= 4/9/2020 =

== TPC Welding ==
	Apparently Flux people talked to Spirit to ask if we were working together
	Set up meeting for next week to --finally-- get trial
	
== Research ==
	Nothing new
	
== Mechanics of Materials ==
	Set up Roy and Khadija as TA's for course
	Ready for next week
	Need to start recording next week's lectures
	
== Damage Tolerance ==
	Need to finish grading abstracts
	Need to post HW7 solutions
	Need to finish recording and post cycle counting lecture
	
== Home ==
	Set up a new basketball hoop for Calvin, works great!
	Still need to re-solder the logic converter, but I think 2/4 pins are working fine
	Bigger problem: the relay was not working. After some debugging, it worked with my normal arduino, I hope that by powering the relay separately I will be able to run it from my pro mini
	
= 4/10/2020 =

== TPC Welding ==
	Morning meeting canceled
	Nothing new
	
== Research ==
	NASA proposal w/ Dr. Asmatulu did not get funded, need to start looking out for new proposals and publications
	
== Mechanics of Materials ==
	Very quiet day in the recitation section
	Student feedback so far has been very positive on lecture format
	Second student complained about the date of lectures, need to publish calendar better
	Decided to post exam a little earlier (4/13 on Monday)
	Need to record next lecture
	
== Damage Tolerance ==
	Recorded and uploaded cycle counting lecture
	Graded project abstracts
	Need to grade homework
	
== Home ==
	I think I will be able to work relay with separate power, might need to short-circuit leds to save power, that might also let me skip the logic converter
	Calvin is enjoying his basketball hoop, but still needs some encouragement
