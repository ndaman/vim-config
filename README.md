# vim-config

I wanted to centralize my vim config settings and any other installation instructions so that I can more easily keep things consistent. I will also keep track of things to improve to make the process easier.

Install neovim (on windows use chocolatey, which installs nvim-qt by default)

Currently have three files to track: 
- init.vim (vimrc) 
- ginit.vim (gui settings) 
- markdown.snip (custom snippets for markdown)

Need to separately install python 3 and fzf.

On chromebook (chromebrew), need to force installation of old version of deoplete to work with older supplied version of neovim.
